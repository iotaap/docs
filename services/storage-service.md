# Storage Module
This module enables every device or data stream to simply send structured messages to the specific topic and store data to the cloud. With this module, edge devices that are often storage limited can now use practically unlimited server space to store their logs, data, configuration or any other data stream, without need for integration of additional services.

## Sending data
After enabling Storage service in your IoTaaP console, we will connect to the IoTaaP Network using 3rd party MQTT Client tool. In other tutorials, we will be using ESP32 and other solutions to store real data from real devices.
