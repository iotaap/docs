# Enabling and disabling services
Services can be managed through [IoTaaP Console](https://console.iotaap.io/pages/account/edit). Each service can be enabled for multiple IoTaaP Network users, but analytics and monthly payment is collected together (not per user).

In order to manage IoTaaP Services, simply head to **Account** in **IoTaaP console** and scroll down to **IoTaaP Services**. 

> Please note that you have to generate IoTaaP Link in order to manage your services!
