# Modules and Services
The IoTaaP network offers a range of modules or services that enhance the capabilities of IoT devices, data streams, and the network itself. These modules provide additional functionalities, such as enabling basic devices to send SMS messages even without a SIM card, or facilitating easy data storage on the server through a simple operation. Modules continue to grow and evolve, ranging from simple ones like the Heartbeat module to more advanced and complex ones, such as AI anomaly detection and cybersecurity features.
